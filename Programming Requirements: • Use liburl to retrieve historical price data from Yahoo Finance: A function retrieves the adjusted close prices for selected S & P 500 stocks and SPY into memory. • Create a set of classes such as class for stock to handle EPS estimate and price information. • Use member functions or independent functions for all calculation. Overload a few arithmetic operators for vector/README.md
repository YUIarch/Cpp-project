Programming Requirements:
• Use liburl to retrieve historical price data from Yahoo Finance: A function retrieves
the adjusted close prices for selected S & P 500 stocks and SPY into memory.
• Create a set of classes such as class for stock to handle EPS estimate and price
information.
• Use member functions or independent functions for all calculation. Overload a few
arithmetic operators for vector/matrix.
• The stocks and their corresponding price information for each group should be
stored in a STL map, with stock symbol as its keys.
• The expected AAR, AAR STD, and expected CAAR and CAAR STD for 3 groups
are presented in a matrix. The row of the matrix is the group#, matrix columns are
for AAR, AAR-STD, CAAR, CAAR-STD
• Use Excel Driver or gnuplot to show the CAAR from all 3 groups in one graph.
